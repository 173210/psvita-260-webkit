PSVita Webkit Exploit

This is a PoC of webkit exploit running on psvita.
The PoC will work on firmware 2.60 only, but should be simple to adapt to new firmwares.

The modified PoC removes the JIT working of the exploit and replaces it with the ability
to launch ROP based scripts. This will allow interested developers to play around with
ROP and learn about the securities of modern day systems.
